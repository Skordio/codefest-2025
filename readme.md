# Codefest 2025 Draft Repo

Here I am just gonna make a django app and maybe a frontend to play around with Gemini API

## Repo setup

To setup this repo on your machine, you need python and node

## Python setup

This repo uses venv for python library management. 

Create a virtual environment
```
python3 -m venv .venv
```

then activate the environment in your terminal:

Mac
```
source ./venv/bin/activate
```

Windows powershell
```
./venv/Scripts/Activate.ps1
```


then install the libraries like this:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
